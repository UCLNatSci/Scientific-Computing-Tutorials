    "\n",
    "A genome is an organism's complete set of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), a chemical compound that contains the genetic instructions needed to develop and direct the activities of every organism. A strand of DNA is made of four chemical units, called nucleotide bases. The bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assessment you will use a method similar to the Human Genome Project to sequence DNA. In a laboratory, a strand of DNA is duplicated several times, then all the strands are broken into smaller, overlapping fragments. The bases of the smaller fragments are determined and entered into a file. The goal of this assessment is to reconstruct a full DNA strand from the set of DNA fragments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic operation is to process all the fragments by matching two fragments and merging them into a new fragment. This process decreases the number of fragments by one since two fragments are merged into one. The match/merge operation is repeated until there is only one fragment left - this will be the original DNA - or until no further matches are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our starting point is a list of strings, each string representing a DNA fragment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "['tgaaaattcctttctattttaggccc', 'tgaaaattcctttctattttaggcccatgcaat', 'ggcattagggcggttaa', 'atgcaatggcattagggcggttaa', 'ggttaa', 'tgaaaattcctttctattt', 'taggcccatgcaatggcattagggc']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We identify a pair of strings where the end of one string matches the start of the other.\n",

    "The pair of strings are then replaced by the merged string in the list.\n",
