    "Write a function `translate` which returns the one-character amino-acid string corresponding to the given three-character codon.\n",

    "Write a function `translate_sequence` which which returns the amino acid sequence corresponding to the given RNA sequence. Your function should call `start_index` in order to determine the start position. Then it should loop over the characters in `sequence`, 3 characters at a time, until one of the stop codons is found. For each 3-character codon, call `translate` to determine the corresponding amino acid character. Return the string formed by concatenating the amino acid characters.\n",
