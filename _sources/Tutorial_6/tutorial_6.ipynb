    "\n",
    "- The first three fields are the x, y and z coordinates for the star. We will ignore the z coordinate, and use only the x and y coordinates. Each axis in the coordinate system goes from -1 to +1, and the centre point is 0,0.\n",
    "- The fourth field is the Henry Draper number, which is simply a unique identifier for the star.\n",
    "- The fifth field is the magnitude (or brightness) of the star.\n",
