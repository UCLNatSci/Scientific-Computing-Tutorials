    "L-systems were invented by Biologist Aristid Lindenmayer, to model the growth of biological systems.\n",
    "The rules of an L-system are a set of instructions for transforming one string into another string. Here is an example of an L-system:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Axiom|Rule 1|Rule 2|\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "|`A`|`A->B`|`B->AB`|\n",
    "\n",
    "The axiom is a string representing the starting point for the system. The rules represent string replacements, where `X->Y` means replace all instances of symbol `X` with string `Y`, in this case resulting in a new string where each `A` has been replaced with `B` and `B` has been replaced with `AB`. Repeated application of the rules gives a sequence of strings.\n",

    "|3|`BAB`|\n",
    "|4|`ABBAB`|\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use symbols with special meanings, we can use the L-system to program a graphical turtle. Using the symbols `\"F\"` (draw forward 1 unit) `\"-\"` (turn left 60 degrees) and `\"+\"` (turn right 60 degrees), the following L-system implements a famous drawing called the Koch curve.\n",

    "- Write a function `draw_sequence(sequence, angle)` which draws a figure by following the instructions encoded in the string `sequence`.
