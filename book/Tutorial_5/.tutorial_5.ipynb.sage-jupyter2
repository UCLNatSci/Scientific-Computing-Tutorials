In this part you will extend to two dimensions.\n\nConsider a projectile fired horizontally from the surface of the earth. Its position $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2)$ relative to the centre of The Earth and its velocity is $\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2)$. The distance between the projectile and the centre of The Earth is $r = \\sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2}$.\n\nThe vector equations governing its motion are:\n$$\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} &= \\mathbf{v}\\\\\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} &= -\\frac{Gm_\\mathrm{e}}{r^3}\\mathbf{x}\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nDefining a timestep $\\Delta t$:\n\n$$ \\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{x}_{i+1} &= \\mathbf{x}_i + \\mathbf{v}_i\\Delta t\\\\\n\\mathbf{v}_{i+1} &= \\mathbf{v}_i -\\frac{Gm_\\mathrm{e}}{r^3}\\mathbf{x_i}\\Delta t\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nSince $\\mathbf{x}_i$ and $\\mathbf{x}_i$ and are 2-dimensional vectors, `x` and `v` are now 2 by `n_steps` numpy arrays, where `x[0,i]` and `x[1,i]` are $x_1$ and $x_2$ co-ordinates of the projectile at timestep `i`.\n\n```\nx = np.zeros((2, n_steps))\nv = np.zeros((2, n_steps))\n```\n\nThe update step for the position `x` becomes:\n\n```\nx[:,i+1] = x[:,i] + v[:,i] * delta_t\n```\n\nDetermine the code for the update step for the velocity `v` (hint: first calculate the value of the scalar quantity `r`).\n\nUse this code to write a simulation of the trajectory of the projectile.
