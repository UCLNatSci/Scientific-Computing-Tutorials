    "Given a graph, we can define two properties **average clustering coefficient** and **average path distance**.\n",

    "The average clustering coeffient is defined as the sum of the clustering coefficients of all nodes in the graph, divided by the number of nodes in the graph (considering only nodes where it is defined, i.e. nodes with at least 2 neighbours).\n",
