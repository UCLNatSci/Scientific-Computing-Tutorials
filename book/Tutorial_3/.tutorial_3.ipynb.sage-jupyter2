We define the 'Collatz number' of an integer $n$ to be the number of iterations in the sequence.\n \nWrite a program which generates a line graph with integers 0 ... 100 on the x-axis, and Collatz number on the y axis.\n ","pos":10,"type":"cell"}

Write a program which plots a graph of the cannonball's trajectory.\n\n```{image} cannon.jpg\n:width: 200px\n```\n\nSet the initial positions `x` and `y` to zero and velocities `vx` and `vy` to `np.cos(theta)` and `np.sin(theta)`. Each time step, update the positions using `x = x + vx * DELTA_T` and `y = y + vy * DELTA_T`. Update the velocity `vy = vy - g * DELTA_T`. The x velocity remains constant.\nCreate lists `x_list` and `y_list` to store the x and y positions, appending the new positions at each timestep.\n\nRepeat until the `y` position becomes negative (what kind of loop should you use for this?). Finally, use `matplotlib` to plot the two lists.\n\n\nExtend your program so that it prints `hit` or `miss` depending if the cannonball lands less than 20m from a target placed at a distance `dis` from the cannon.\n\n```{image} cannon_output.png\n:width: 200px\n```\n`hit`","pos":8,"type":"cell"}
