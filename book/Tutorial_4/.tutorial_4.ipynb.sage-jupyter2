Make sure to include upper and lower case characters but do not count them separately. Do not count punctuation or spaces.\n\n```{image} alphabet.png\n:width: 400px\n```\n\nUse the following code to load the contents of the text file into a string variable:\n```\nwith open(\"english.txt\") as f:\n     text = f.read()\n```\n\nHint: create a variable to store the alphabet and use `string.find` to locate each character in the alphabet.\n\n### Part 2\nLet $A_i$ be the relative frequency of letter $i$ in text $A$, where a is letter 0, b is letter 1 etc. (E.g. if A = \"alphabet!\", $A_0 = 2/8 = 0.25$ since the letter a appears 2 times out of 8 alphabetic characters). We define a similarity index for two pieces of text using the following formula:\n\n$\\sum_{i=0}^{25} (A_i - B_i)^2$\n\nWrite a program which predicts the language of a piece of text by comparing the text to the each of the thre languages English, French and Spanish. Relative frequencies for each these languages can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency. (Make sure the relative frequences sum to 1!)\n\nYour program should calculate the value of the similarity index for each of the languages then print the name of the language with the lowest score.","pos":2,"type":"cell"}

We can represent an RNA sequence by a string consisting of the four letters `A`, `U`, `C` and `G`.\n```\nrna_seq = \"GCAUAUGUUCAUAUGAAUA\"\n```\neach three character substring identifies a 'codon' which either identifies a specific amino acid within a protein, or a 'start' or 'stop' instruction.  \n\nGiven an RNA sequence, the amino acid-encoding codons (in **bold**) lie between with the first 'start' codon and the first 'stop' codon (in <span style=\"color:red\">red</span>).\n\nGCAU<span style=\"color:red\">**AUG**</span>**UUCAUA**<span style=\"color:red\">UGA</span>AUA\n\nWhen translating the RNA to a protein, the following steps are followed:\n\n1. Read along the sequence until the start codon `AUG` is found.\n1. Read along the sequence three characters at a time. Look up each three character codon in the translation table to determine the corresponding amino acid.\n1. Stop when the first stop codon (`UUA`, `UAG` or `UGA`) is found.\n\nThe above sequence therefore comprises the following three codons:\n\n```none\nAUG\nUUC\nAUA\n```\nand translates to the amino acid sequence:\n\n```none\nMFI\n```\n\nYour goal is to write a program which translates a string representing RNA sequence into a string representing the sequence of amino acids after translation.\n\nBy following the steps below, write a program which translates an RNA sequence into a sequence of amino-acids.\n\n### Step 1\n\nWrite a function `start_index(sequence)` that returns the index position of the first occurrence of the start codon `AUG` in the given string `sequence`.\n\nLoop over the characters in the string and check whether each three character substring is equal to the 'start' codon, `AUG`. Once you find the start codon, use the `break` keyword to exit the loop then return the index position.\n \n```\ndef start_index(sequence):\n    # loop over characters in the string\n    # return the index of first occurrence of 'AUG'\n\nj = start_index(rna_seq)\nprint(j)\n# Should print 4\n```\n\n### Step 2\n\nWrite a function `translate` which returns the one-character amino-acid string corresponding to the given three-character codon.\n\n```\ndef translate(codon):\n    # look up codon in the translation table\n\nx = translate(\"AAA\")\nprint(x)\n# Should print 'K'\n```\n\n### Step 3\n\nWrite a function `translate_sequence` which which returns the amino acid sequence corresponding to the given RNA sequence. Your function should call `start_index` in order to determine the start position. Then it should loop over the characters in `sequence`, 3 characters at a time, until one of the stop codons is found. For each 3-character codon, call `translate` to determine the corresponding amino acid character. Return the string formed by concatenating the amino acid characters.\n\n```\ndef translate_sequence(sequence):\n    # Determine the start index\n    # Loop over 3-character substrings of sequence until one of the three stop codons is found\n    # Call translate on each codon\n    # Concatenate the resulting characters\n\nrna_seq = \"GCAUAUGUUCAUAUGAAUA\"\naa = translate_seqeuence(rna_seq)\nprint(aa)\n# should print 'MFI'\n```\n\n### Step 4\n\nTest your finished program against the following RNA sequences:\n\n```\nrna_1 = \"CAACAAUGCUCCCCGCCUAGUUG\"\n# should return 'MLPA'\n\nrna_2 = \"UAAAAUGAAUAAUAGAUAA\"\n# should return 'MNNR'\n```","pos":0,"type":"cell"}
