Extract the co-ordinates into two separate lists `x_coords` and `y-coords` then plot them on a scatter plot.\n\n- use `string.split` to generate a list of co-ordinate pairs\n- loop over the list and split each pair into x and y co-ordinates\n- convert each to a number and add to lists `x_coords` and `y_coords`\n- plot using `plt.scatter(x_coords, y_coords)`\n\nAdapt your code so that it plots the image the correct way up in a figure of  suitable size.","pos":2,"type":"cell"}
