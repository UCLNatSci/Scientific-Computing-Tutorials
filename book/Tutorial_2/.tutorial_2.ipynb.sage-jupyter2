We can estimate the volume of a solid of revolution by dividing it into a sequence of stacked discs and summing the volume of each.\n\nA sphere of radius $R$ is formed by rotating the curve $y = \\sqrt{R^2 - x^2}$ around the x-axis between $-R$ and $R$.\n\n![a](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/0*d7QEcno6XhPOiJSt.png)\n\nUse the following steps to estimate the volume of a sphere of radius 1.\n\n1. Write a function `vol_disc(R, x, dx)` which returns the volume of the disc centred at position `x` with thickness `dx`. \n1. Estimate the volume of a sphere of radius 1 by dividing the figure into 10 discs equally spaced between `-1` and `1` [use a value of 3.14159 for $\\pi$].\n1. Write a function `sphere_vol(R, n)` which returns the estimate of the volume of a sphere of radius `R` calculated by dividing it into `n` discs.\n1. The estimate should get more accurate as we increase `n`. We can estimate the accuracy by calculating the difference between `sphere_vol(R, n)` and `sphere_vol(R, n-1)`. For `R = 1`, how large does `n` need to be so that difference between consecutive estimates is less than $10^{-4}$?","pos":4,"type":"cell"}

Investgate the [Prime Number Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem).\n1. Write a function `volume_of_revolution(func, x_min, x_max, n)` which calculates the volume of the surface of revolution of the curve given by function `func`. `func(x)` should be a function of a single variable which returns the y-value of the curve given the x value. You'll have to learn how to [pass a function as an argument to another function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/passing-function-as-an-argument-in-python/). Test your function by calculating the volume of a sphere,  a paraboloid and another curve of your choice.\n\n","pos":6,"type":"cell"}
