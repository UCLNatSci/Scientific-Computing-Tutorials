# ## Introduction
# 
# A **graph** is a collection of nodes connected by edges. The graph $G_1$ below has 5 nodes and 7 edges:
# 
# ![G1](graph1.png "G1")

# The adjacency matrix of a graph with $n$ nodes is an $n$ by $n$ array, where the element in position $i, j$ is 1 if node $i$ is connected to node $j$ by an edge, otherwise 0. The adjacency matrix of the graph $G_1$ is:
# 
# $$ \begin{bmatrix}
# 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
# 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1\\
# 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
# 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1\\
# 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0\\
# \end{bmatrix} $$
# 
# In Python, this can be represented as a `numpy` array:
# 
# ```
# import numpy as np
# G_1 = np.array([[0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
#                 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
#                 [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
#                 [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
#                 [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]])
# ```
# 
# 
# ## Question 1 [4]
# 
# The **neighbours** of a node $i$ are the nodes directly connected to node $i$ by an edge. For example, in graph $G_1$ the neighbours of node 0 are nodes 1 and 2.
# 
# Write a function `neighbours(A, i)` which, given an adjacency matrix `A` and node index `i` returns a list of neighbours of node `i`.
# 
# Test it with the code below:
# ```
# import numpy as np
# G_1 = np.array([[0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
#                 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
#                 [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
#                 [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
#                 [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]])
#               
# neighbours(G_1, 0)
# 
# [1, 2] # or [2, 1]
# ```
# 
# ## Question 2 [5]
# 
# The **clustering coefficient** of a node measures how densely connected the node's neighbours are. If the node has fewer than 2 neighbours then its clustering coefficient is zero, otherwise it is defined as follows:
# 
# $$\gamma(i) = m/(n^2âˆ’n)$$
# 
# where $n$ is the number of neighbouring nodes and $m$ is the number of edges between neighbouring nodes.
# 
# In $G_1$, node 2 has 4 neighbours connected by 3 edges (coloured red in the figure below), so $\gamma(2) = 3 / (4^2 - 4) = 3/12 = 1/4$.
# 
# ![G1](graph2.png "G1")

# 
# 
# Write a function `clustering_coefficient(A, i)` which returns the clustering coefficient of node `i`, and test it using the code below:
# 
# ```
# clustering_coefficient(G_1, 2)
# 
# 0.25
# ```
# 
# ## Question 3 [5]
# 
# A **path** is a sequence of nodes, where each node is connected to the next by an edge and no node is repeated. For example `[0, 2, 1, 4]` is a path in the graph $G_1$, but `[0, 1, 2, 0]` and `[0, 3, 4]` are not.
# 
# Given a list `nodes` and graph with adjacency matrix `A`, write a function `is_path(A, nodes)` which returns `True` if `nodes` is a path in the graph, and otherwise returns `False`. Test your function with the three lists `[0, 2, 1, 4]`, `[0, 1, 2, 0]` and `[0, 3, 4]`.
# 
# 
# ## Question 4 [4]
# 
# The **average clustering coefficient** of a graph is defined as the sum of the clustering coefficients of all nodes in the graph, divided by the number of nodes in the graph.
# 
# Write a function `average_clustering_coefficient(A)` and test the function against the graph $G_1$.
# 
# ## Question 5 [4]
# 
# The Python library `networkx` can be used to analyse and plot graphs. Import the library, and use it to create a graph of $G_1$. Plot the graph using the function `networkx.draw`.
# 
# https://networkx.org/documentation/networkx-1.7/tutorial/tutorial.html
# 
# ## Question 6 [8]
# 
# Each of the three files `graphXX.txt` contains the definition of a graph. Each file is structured as follows:
# 
# 1. graph name
# 1. number of nodes
# 1. The adjacency matrix, with one line per row
# 
# Write a script which reads the data from each file and generates a figure containing a plot of the graph annotated with the name and average clustering coefficient. Your three plots should look similar to the example below.
