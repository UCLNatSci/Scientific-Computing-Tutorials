# # Practice 5

# ## Question 1
# 
# Create a 2 by 3 numpy array containing the following data:
# 
# $$
# \begin{bmatrix}
# 10 & 12 & 13\\
# 5 & 6 & 7
# \end{bmatrix}
# $$
# 
# Use slice notation to create one-dimensional arrays containing:
# 
# 1. The first row
# 1. The last column
# 
# Calculate:
# 
# 1. A 3 element array containing the sum of each of the three columns
# 1. A 2 element array containing the sum of each of the two rows

# ## Question 2
# 
# A particle follows a trajectory given by the following equations between $t=0$s and $t = 10$s:
# 
# $$
# x = 4\sin(7t)\\
# y = 4\cos(6t)
# $$
# 
# 
# 
# 1. Use `np.arange` to create an array `t` containing 100 evenly spaced time points from 0 to 10.
# 1. Calculate arrays `x` and `y` containing the x and y co-ordinates
# 1. plot the x and y co-ordinates against time on the same graph.
# 1. On a separate graph, plot x against y.

# ## Question 3
# The logistic equation describes the growth of a population where the growth rate is limited by resources.
# 
# $$x_{i+1} = x_i + r(1-x_i/K)x_i$$
# 
# $r$ and $K$, both greater than zero, are parameters of the model.
# 
# Adapt the 'Population Growth' code in the notes to simulate the growth of a population undergoing logistic growth. Experiment with different values of $r$ and $K$. What do the two parameters represent?
