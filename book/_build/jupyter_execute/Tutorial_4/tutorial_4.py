# 
# In biology, an RNA sequence consists of a chain of the nucleotides Adenine, Uracil, Cytosine and Guanine in a specific order. We can represent an RNA sequence by a string consisting of the four letters `A`, `U`, `C` and `G`.
# ```
# rna_seq = "GCAUAUGUUCAUAUGAAUA"
# ```
# each three character substring identifies a 'codon' which either identifies a specific amino acid within a protein, or a 'start' or 'stop' instruction.  
# 
# Given an RNA sequence, the amino acid-encoding codons (in **bold**) lie between with the first 'start' codon and the first 'stop' codon (in <span style="color:red">red</span>).
# 
# GCAU<span style="color:red">**AUG**</span>**UUCAUA**<span style="color:red">UGA</span>AUA
# 
# When translating the RNA to a protein, the following steps are followed:
# 
# 1. Read along the sequence until the start codon `AUG` is found.
# 1. Read along the sequence three characters at a time. Look up each three character codon in the translation table to determine the corresponding amino acid.
# 1. Stop when the first stop codon (`UUA`, `UAG` or `UGA`) is found.
# 
# The above sequence therefore comprises the following three codons:
# 
# ```none
# AUG
# UUC
# AUA
# ```
# and translates to the amino acid sequence:
# 
# ```none
# MFI
# ```
# 
# Your goal is to write a program which translates a string representing RNA sequence into a string representing the sequence of amino acids after translation.
# 
# By following the steps below, write a program which translates an RNA sequence into a sequence of amino-acids.
# 
# ### Step 1
# 
# Write a function `start_index(sequence)` that returns the index position of the first occurrence of the start codon `AUG` in the given string `sequence`.
# 
# Loop over the characters in the string and check whether each three character substring is equal to the 'start' codon, `AUG`. Once you find the start codon, use the `break` keyword to exit the loop then return the index position.
#  
# ```
# def start_index(sequence):
#     # loop over characters in the string
#     # return the index of first occurrence of 'AUG'
# 
# j = start_index(rna_seq)
# print(j)
# # Should print 4
# ```
# 
# ### Step 2
# 
# Write a function `translate` which returns the one-character amino-acid string corresponding to the given three-character codon.
# 
# ```
# def translate(codon):
#     # look up codon in the translation table
# 
# x = translate("AAA")
# print(x)
# # Should print 'K'
# ```
# 
# ### Step 3
# 
# Write a function `translate_sequence` which which returns the amino acid sequence corresponding to the given RNA sequence. Your function should call `start_index` in order to determine the start position. Then it should loop over the characters in `sequence`, 3 characters at a time, until one of the stop codons is found. For each 3-character codon, call `translate` to determine the corresponding amino acid character. Return the string formed by concatenating the amino acid characters.
# 
# ```
# def translate_sequence(sequence):
#     # Determine the start index
#     # Loop over 3-character substrings of sequence until one of the three stop codons is found
#     # Call translate on each codon
#     # Concatenate the resulting characters
# 
# rna_seq = "GCAUAUGUUCAUAUGAAUA"
# aa = translate_seqeuence(rna_seq)
# print(aa)
# # should print 'MFI'
# ```
# 
# ### Step 4
# 
# Test your finished program against the following RNA sequences:
# 
# ```
# rna_1 = "CAACAAUGCUCCCCGCCUAGUUG"
# # should return 'MLPA'
# 
# rna_2 = "UAAAAUGAAUAAUAGAUAA"
# # should return 'MNNR'
# ```

# ## Question 2 (Optional)
# 
# First upload the following four files into your working folder in Cocalc.
# 
# <a href="../tutorial_4/english.txt" download>english.txt</a>  
# <a href="../tutorial_4/english.txt" download>french.txt</a>  
# <a href="../tutorial_4/english.txt" download>german.txt</a>  
# <a href="../tutorial_4/english.txt" download>spanish.txt</a>  
# 
# ### Part 1
# Write a program which counts the frequency of each letter in the file `english.txt`, and displays the results as a [bar graph](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.bar.html). Make sure to include upper and lower case characters but do not count them separately. Do not count punctuation or spaces.
# 
# ```{image} alphabet.png
# :width: 400px
# ```
# 
# Use the following code to load the contents of the text file into a string variable:
# ```
# with open("english.txt") as f:
#      text = f.read()
# ```
# 
# Hint: create a variable to store the alphabet and use `string.find` to locate each character in the alphabet.
# 
# ### Part 2
# Let $A_i$ be the relative frequency of letter $i$ in text $A$, where a is letter 0, b is letter 1 etc. (E.g. if A = "alphabet!", $A_0 = 2/8 = 0.25$ since the letter a appears 2 times out of 8 alphabetic characters). We define a similarity index for two pieces of text using the following formula:
# 
# $\sum_{i=0}^{25} (A_i - B_i)^2$
# 
# Write a program which predicts the language of a piece of text by comparing the text to the each of the four languages English, French, German and Spanish. Relative frequencies for each these languages can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency. (Make sure the relative frequences sum to 1!)
# 
# Your program should calculate the value of the similarity index for each of the languages then print the name of the language with the lowest score.
