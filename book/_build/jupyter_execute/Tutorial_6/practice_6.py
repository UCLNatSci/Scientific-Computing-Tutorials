# ## Question 2
# The `time()` function returns the number of seconds which have elapsed since January 1 1970.
# ```
# from time import time
# print(time())
# 
# 1609431989.253785
# ```
# 
# Write a program which writes the current time to the file `current_time.txt`. Investigate the difference between opening the file in write mode versus append mode.

# ## Question 3
# Write a program which creates 9 files named `element_1.txt` to `element_9.txt` containing the name and description of the first 9 chemical elements listed in the file `periodic_table.csv`. E.g., `element_1.txt` should contain:
# ```
# Hydrogen
# colorless gas
