# # Practice 3
# ## Question 1
# 
# Adapt the first example in the notes so that every 5 timesteps the population decreases by 20.
# 
# What value should 20 be changed to so that the popultation is roughly constant over the long term (don't calculate this; just get a rough figure by experimenting and looking the resulting graph).

# In[3]:





# ## Question 2
# 
# Use a `for` loop to generate the following lists:
# 1. `[5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]`
# 1. `[1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000]`
# 1. `[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]` (hint: use the `%` operator)

# ## Question 3
# 
# Look up the predicted daily maximum and minimum temperatures for the next 10 days according to the BBC weather forecast.
# 
# https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/2643743
# 
# Create two lists containing the maximum and minimum temperatures and plot them as two separate lines on a line graph, including axis labels and title. Look up how to add a legend in the [Matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html).

# ## Question 4
# 
# The following code initialises a list `x` with ten integers.
# 
# Write code which creates four lists, containing:
# - Every element of `x` at an even index.
# - Every even element.
# - All elements in reverse order.
# - Only the first and last element.

# In[1]:


x = [18, 19, 10, 19, 11, 7, 12, 6, 5, 4]
